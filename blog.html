		<p>This assignment was fairly simple considering we had to use HTML only. 
			I have had an experience with HTML and CSS previously; for fun. Because 
			I wanted to challenge myself, I included a CSS file. The assignment reminded
			me of some of the things I forgot like centering a block element. For the rest 
			of the properties I kind of knew what I was doing, but I needed a little bit 
			of refreshers. I used W3 School to figure things out. I hope in the next 
			assignment to be able to understand CSS so I can apply the design naturally.
