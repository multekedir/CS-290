		<h3> 09/29/2017 </h3>
		<p>This assignment was fairly simple considering we had to use HTML only. 
			I have had an experience with HTML and CSS previously; for fun. Because 
			I wanted to challenge myself, I included a CSS file. The assignment reminded
			me of some of the things I forgot like centering a block element. For the rest 
			of the properties I kind of knew what I was doing, but I needed a little bit 
			of refreshers. I used W3 School to figure things out. I hope in the next 
			assignment to be able to understand CSS so I can apply the design naturally.

		<p>This assignment was kind of hard. It took me a while how flex display worked.
           I looked at w3 School to see how it is done but it took me a while to understand.
           The problem I was having was understanding how the give HTML war organized. 
           I first set the result section to flex display it didn't work so I set the whole 
           content to flex display and it worked. It took a lot of trial and error but I 
           figured it all out. At the end of this assignment I believe, I have a good 
           understanding of flex display.

		<h3> 11/5/2017 </h3>
		<p>This assignment was not hard or easy and it took a while to get done. 
			One challenge I had was coming up with a simple function and doing it 
			in the easy way. The class lectures were very useful because I had no idea
			on adding a post and removing one. I am now very confident in creating dynamic
			pages using JavaScript.
